## Poisson Distribution
This section is dedicated to the first three challenges of homework 2: using the poisson distribution to determine three probabilities. First: the probability that the researcher will hear more than 8 calls:

```{r}
ppois(q=8,lambda=15,lower.tail = FALSE) 
#1-ppois was changed to ppois (lower.tail=FALSE)
#lambda represents the mean
```
Second, the probability that she hears 0 calls:
```{r}
dpois(x=0,lambda=15) 
#dpois looks at the probility that the results will be exactly x
#again, lambda represents the mean 
```
Third, the probability that she hears 3 calls:
```{r}
dpois(x=3,lambda=15) 
#same scenario as the second challenge, just with x=3 instead of x=0
```
## Poisson mass function plot
This section is dedicated to the fourth challenge: plotting the poisson distribution.

`Yong's comments:`The comments explain your choices (e.g., why you picked a bar plot), which is great for understanding your rationale
```{r}
barplot(dpois(x=0:30,lambda=15),ylim=c(0,0.15),space=0,names.arg=0:30,
        ylab="Probability",xlab="Number of calls")
#What kind of graph to use is not specified so I just picked bargraph 'cuz I like them
#setting the depois function to be 0:30 gives the specified range and lambda is still 15
#setting ylim makes the bargraph more readable
#space=0 also just makes the bargraph nicer
#banes.arg labels the x axis with numbers
#ylab labels the y axis. I picked probability but you can use anything
#xlab labels the x axis. Again, I picked number of calls but you can use anything
#the line separation is there purely to make the whole text visible on knitted html
```
## Simulated results
This section is dedicated to the fifth challenge: simulating the results.
```{r}
rpois(n=104,lambda=15)
#rpois randomly generates n amount of results based on the lambda
```
## Plotted simulated results
This section is dedicated to the sixth and final challenge: plotting the simulated results

```{r}
r<-rpois(n=104,lambda=15)
hist(r,xlim=c(0,30))
#Ok so this is kinda the same process as above. I chose to give rpois it's own line of code 
  #instead of just writing it into the histogram.
#I did not properly read the instructions the first time and have corrected that error
```
Both graphs have semi-similar shapes however, the bargraph of part 4 is much smoother than the histogram of part 6.
